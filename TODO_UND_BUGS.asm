NOT AN ASM FILE LOL

TO DO:
-export sprite for NPC
-database for NPC and chest (and other event) scripts, so u can export an index that loads the proper script for the event
-battle scene
-ingame menu






BUGS:
-player spawning direction (player always spawns in down direction before updating in the right direction)
-game crash on player.gd because class name check fails (completely non sense)
